    # Image Captioning + Segmentation (Streamlit-ready)


    This repository is prepared for Streamlit Cloud deployment (Python 3.9 compatible).


    ## How to deploy
1. Push these files to a GitHub repository.
2. Create a new app on Streamlit Cloud and connect to the repo.
3. Set the main file to `app_streamlit.py` and deploy.

Notes: the first run downloads pretrained models (BLIP from Hugging Face and Mask R-CNN from TorchVision). This may take a few minutes.
